    Purpose: This program will read a file provided by the user.
    It will iterate through the puzzle grid in the file and find the words
    located at the bottom of the file. It will iterate with 8 directions
    left to right horizontally, up and down vertically, diagonally right
    to left and left to right searching for words. Finally, it will print
    out the grid with the words that are found. Otherwise, it will print
    (.) to complete the grid.
